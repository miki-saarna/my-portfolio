            <h3>The Journey Begins</h3>
            <p>I grew up in Kansas City for most of my life, but shortly after graduating from high school, I departed my parents' house to attend a Gap-year program called <a href="https://www.generationpeaceacademy.org/">Generation Peace Academy</a> (GPA). This was a very moumental and precious time of my life where I explored different topics such as my own character, spirituality, relationships, my dreams and aspirations and much more. I ended up extending my time in GPA to a total of 3 years</p>
            <hr>
            <p>About a year after graduating from GPA, I went on a bike-packing trip from New Jersey to Detroit (I also road through a small portion of Canada). This trip taught me that I can accomplish anything I set my heart and mind to.</p>
            <img src="#" alt="my sick 'ride' on my 2 week long bike-packing trip">
            <p>I moved to Las Vegas a month after my bike-packing trip and have been living here ever since. I worked with various E-commerce start-ups until I decided to have my career change and study software engineering with Thinkful. During this time I also met and married my wife Misato.<p>

            <h3>Explored & Exploring</h3>
            <p>Don't let the heading of this section fool you - this isn't a recollection of the Himalayan Mountains I've traversed, the get-away trains I have illegally boarded, or the jungles of the Amazon I narrowly escaped death fighting a jaguar... because I have done none of those things. Rather, this will be a list of topics or interests I have explored or currently exploring, and perhaps you may be interested in some of them.<p>
              <ul>
                <li>Software engineering (obviously)</li>
                <li>Reading non-fiction</li>
                <li>Cooking</li>
                <li>Soccer and volleyball</li>
                <li>Brewing speciality pour-over coffee</li>
                <li>Traveling and exploring new areas and cultures</li>
              </ul>
