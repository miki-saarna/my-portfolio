            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I grew up in Kansas City for most of my life, but currently reside in Las Vegas, NV.</p>
            <p>What I have done in the past several years:
            <ul>
              <li>Attended a gap-year program called <a href="https://www.generationpeaceacademy.org/">Generation Peace Academy (GPA)</a></li>
              <li>Went bikepacking from New Jersey to Detroit (also went through Canada a little)</li>
              <li>Began working within E-commerce start-ups with a fairly large Amazon-presence</li>
              <li>Began an online E-commerce store called YUBIWA</li>
              <li>Married the love of my life</li>
              </ul>
              <hr>
            <!-- speaking in regards to software engineering -->
              <h2>Me & Software Engineering</h2>
              <p>While I studied calculus and phsyics extensively in high school and really came to love it, it's not something that followed my life immediately afterwards. Now, after finally returning to <i>school </i> through <strong>Thinkful</strong>, the same passion and drive to untangle or deconstruct logic and the ability to be able to create worlds run by mathematical operation is resurfacing within me.</p>
              <p>In addition to a love for logical problem solving, I've had many opportunities involving <strong>team-collaboration</strong>. The environment of E-commerce start-ups takes extreme <b>ownership</b> alongside extreme <b>teamwork</b>. I've had experiences working alongside the owner trying to create the best <i>PPC</i> advertising plan and discussing and launching new products for the brand.</p>

            <h2>Explored & Exploring</h2>
            <p>Don't let the heading of this section fool you - this isn't a recollection of the Himalayan Mountains I've traversed, the get-away trains I have illegally boarded, or the jungles of the Amazon I narrowly escaped death fighting a jaguar... because I have done none of those things. Rather, this will be a list of topics or interests I have explored or currently exploring, and perhaps you may be interested in some of them.<p>
              <ul>
                <li>Software engineering</li>
                <li>Reading non-fiction</li>
                <li>Cooking</li>
                <li>Soccer and volleyball</li>
                <li>Brewing speciality pour-over coffee</li>
                <li>Traveling and exploring new areas and cultures</li>
              </ul>
